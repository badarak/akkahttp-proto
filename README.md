# Akka HTTP Proto

A proto project to manipulate Akka HTTP's concepts

I will build a CRUD backend application for managing persons (it's just a fictional application! ).

In the project i will :

- Use the Akka HTTP's routing DSL
- Create directives
- Parse models to and from JSON
- Unit test routes using the Akka HTTP's testkit and scalatest
